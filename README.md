Let's read it through:

The first 4 bytes 00 ea 83 f3 are the program signature (also called the magic), this is a 32 bits integer, represented as four 8 bits slices.

Then the next 128 bits are for the name of the program, the first five 61 6d 65 62 61 are the actual name, the others are zeros because we don't actually need it.

Then we have 4 bytes 00 00 00 17 (so 23) which will be a 32 bits integer with the size in bytes of the program to be executed in the arena of the VM (so only the size of the instructions, without the name, description, signature and so on).

Then we have the description which works exactly the same as the name but it will add four bytes padding at the end of it.
